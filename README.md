# UFO Sighting

## Overview of the analysis:

  This analysis consists of building a website with HTML using JavaScript to read and filter tables. The tables contain information on UFO sightings around the world. The data can be filtered by Date, City, State, Country, or Shape of UFOs. This HTML was built to be visually pleasing and productive with a well-developed template. 
  
## Results:

When entering the HTML website, we can appreciate the layout in which the data is presented in an aesthetically pleasing way. The real data displayed using the filter section can be a powerful tool to browse through the desired information, as seen below in Image 1.

In Image 2 we can observe the desired UFO sightings were only located in the state of Arkansas, if we wanted to be more specific we can type into the other filters to funnel through our data.

## Summary:

To conclude, the filters presented have a drawback, they are case-sensitive. If we were to use capital letters, we would not be able to obtain any results. This is why the samples were portrayed as lower cases in the filter fields. Another setback would include only putting the two-letter abbreviations for each state, by doing so incorrectly, no results would be displayed. Aside from that, this is an essential HTML website built for primary purposes, this is the building block of deeper analysis that can be incorporated using JavaScript. Currently there is no way to filter though the duration of the UFO sightings, which is something else that could be implemented.
